Building test executables

  This example illustrates different approaches to building test executables
  
* Introduction

  The <<testCompile>> goal, bound to the <<test-compile>> phase in the default car lifecycle, will compile any code files found in the test directory (by default, <<src/test/cpp>> and <<src/test/include>> for code and headers respectively).
  
  To run the tests, the test compiled test code objects must be linked to executables. This is done exactly the same way as with production code (see {{{./building-a-simple-executable-for-linux.html}Building a simple executable for Linux}}), except the <<testExecutables>> parameter is used instead of <<executables>>.
  
* Linking explicit executables

  Considering the following plugin configuration:
  
+---------------------------------------------------
<configuration>
  ...
  <testExecutables>
    <all>test = **/test_main.cc</all>
  </testExecutables>
</configuration>
+---------------------------------------------------
   
   This will link a single executable called test, using any main function(s) present in the matching code files. This is very useful when using a test framework that executes multiple test cases via a single entry-point (e.g. googletest), or when running a small number of very particular tests.   

* Linking one executable per test

  One approach to C/C++ testing is to let each test (as in a test code file) be linked as a stand-alone executable. The <<executables>> and <<testExecutables>> mapping syntax allows for an easy way to configure this. Normally you would define executables as &lt;executable&gt;=&lt;code file pattern to include&gt;. However, using <<[]>> instead of an explicit name will trigger linking of each separate code file into an executable with the same name. As an example, consider the following project structure:
  
+---------------------------------------------------
+- src/
  +- test/
    +- cpp/
    | +- SomeTest.cpp
    | +- SomeOtherTest.cpp
    +- include/
+----------------------------------------------------

  The following plugin configuration would then generate two separate test executables named SomeTest and SomeOtherTest:

+---------------------------------------------------
<configuration>
  ...
  <testExecutables>
    <all>
      [] = **/*.cc
    </all>
  </testExecutables>
</configuration>
+---------------------------------------------------

* Mixing approaches

  The approaches described above can of course be mixed. For instance, the following configuration will create one <<performance>> executable, using <<performance/main.cc>> and one executable for each file matching <<unit/*.cc>>: 

+---------------------------------------------------
<configuration>
  ...
  <testExecutables>
    <all>
      performance = performance/main.cc
      [] = unit/*.cc
    </all>
  </testExecutables>
</configuration>
+---------------------------------------------------
