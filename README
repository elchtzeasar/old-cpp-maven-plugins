This project was snatched from the plugin submission to Mojo created by Daniel Franz√©n at Ericsson. You can find the original submission at: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MOJO-1705.

The project will be developed here while waiting for Mojo to react to the submission. If it is accepted the changes made here will probably be submitted.

To install it, clone the repository and run 'mvn install' in the root. Documentation can be generated through 'mvn site'.
